          <span> The Humming-Bird </span>
        </h1>

        <h2 class="poem__subtitle">
          <span> By Beatrice Ravenel </span>
        </h2>

        <p class="poem__body">
          The sundial makes no sign <br>
          At the point of the August noon. <br>
          The sky is of ancient tin, <br>
          And the ring of the mountains diffused and unmade <br>
          (One always remembers them). <br>
          On the twisted dark of the hemlock hedge <br>
          Rain, like a line of shivering violin-bows <br>
          Hissing together, poised on the last turgescent swell, <br>
          Batters the flowers. <br>
          Under the trumpet-vine arbor, <br>
        </p> <hr class="poem__rule">

        <p class="poem__body">
          Clear, precise as an Audubon print, <br>
            The air is of melted glass, <br> 
            Solid, filling interstices <br>  
          Of leaves that are spaced on the spines <br>
            Like a pattern ground into glass; <br>
            Dead, as though dull red glass were poured into the mouth, <br>
          Choking the breath, molding itself into the creases of soft red tissues. <br>
        </p> <hr class="poem__rule">

        <p class="poem__body">
          And a humming-bird darts head first, <br>
          Splitting the air, keen as a spurt of fire shot from the blow-pipe, <br>
          Cracking a star of rays; dives like a flash of fire, <br>
          Forked tail lancing the air, into the immobile trumpet; <br>
          Stands on the air, wings like a triple shadow <br>
          Whizzing around him. <br>
        </p> <hr class="poem__rule">

        <p class="poem__body">
          Shadows thrown on the midnight streets by a snow-flecked arc-light, <br>
          Shadows like sword-play, <br>
          Splinters and spines from a thousand dreams <br>
          Whizz from his wings!
        </p> <hr class="poem__rule">
